Container Bridge Instance Installation:

1). Clone this repo into a Linux instance that supports docker images

2). cd into the cloned repo and run: ./run-reload-bridge.sh

Once the container instance is live, you must configure the bridge and bind it between your mbed Connector account and your IoT Account in AWS

1). Create your IAM Access Key ID and Secret Access Key to enable the AWS CLI in your container. Record those values
    You will also need to record the region of your service (i.e. us-east-1, us-west-2, etc...). Please record that as well. 
    For more information on creating the KeyID and Access Key see: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

2). Next go to https://connector.mbed.com and create your mbed Connector Account

3). Once your Connector account is created, you need to "Access Keys" to create a Connector API Key/Token. Record the Token Value

Now that you have your:

    - AWS Region (i.e. us-east-1)
    
    - AWS Access Key ID for the AWS IoT CLI

    - AWS Secret Access Key for the AWS IoT CLI

    - Connector API Key/Token generated

Go to:  https://[[your containers public IP address]]:8234

    - username: "admin" (no quotes)

    - password: "admin" (no quotes)

Enter each of Key ID, Access Key, and Connector API Token

    - Please press "SAVE" after *each* is entered... 

    - After all 4 are entered and saved, press "RESTART"

Your Connector bridge should now be configured and operational.
